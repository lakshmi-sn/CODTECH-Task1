Overview of the task simple calculator using python programming .
Objective:
Build a command-line program that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Components:
User Input:
The program will prompt the user to:

Enter two numbers for calculation.
Choose an operation (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Mathematical Operations: Implement functions for each of the basic operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Error Handling:

Handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).
Prevent division by zero and notify the user if such an error occurs.
Program Logic: Use conditional statements to:

Identify the operation chosen by the user.
Call the appropriate function to perform the calculation.
Output: Display the result of the operation to the user.

Optional Features (for enhancement):

Allow users to perform multiple calculations in a loop until they choose to exit.
Extend functionality with more complex operations like exponentiation or square root.
Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
